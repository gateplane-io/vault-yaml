# Vault / OpenBao Declarative Configuration

*Vault/OpenBao configuration for mere humans*


## 🚨 Problem statement

Configuring Vault/OpenBao at scale is *complex and opaque*.
It requires a steep learning curve and its flexibility exposes many configuration paths,
most of which are unnecessary for common organizational use cases and difficult to review consistently.

This project distills GatePlane’s operational experience with Vault/OpenBao
into a single, declarative configuration format that surfaces the most common
and security-relevant options explicitly.


## 📋 Overview

This project provides a declarative YAML format for configuring Vault and OpenBao that focuses on solving the critical security question: **"who has what access to what?"**

By defining secret engines, roles, policies, and access control in a single, human-readable YAML file, you get:

- **Simplified configuration** – Only the most common and security-relevant options are exposed explicitly
- **Auditable access control** – Clear visibility into who can access which resources
- **Reduced complexity** – Avoid the steep learning curve and many configuration paths of native Vault
- **GitOps-friendly** – Version control your entire access model alongside your infrastructure

The YAML schema is consumed by Terraform modules located in `/terraform/modules`, with working examples available in `/terraform`.

## 🏗️ Top-level Structure
The [`/access.example.yaml`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/blob/main/access.example.yaml) file demonstrates all supported features with inline comments to guide you through them.

Each top-level key represents a logical Vault mount (secrets engine) or feature group:

```yaml
<pki-engine-path>:
  type: pki
  roles: {...}

<kubernetes-engine-path>:
  type: kubernetes
  roles: {...}

adhoc:
  type: vault
  roles: {...}
```

The key itself is the **mount path** in Vault (e.g., `pki`, `kubernetes`, or a custom path like `ssh/signer`). The special `adhoc` key is reserved for Vault policies not tied to any secrets engine.

### `type`

Defines the Vault engine or feature being configured.

#### Supported examples

* `kubernetes` - [`terraform/modules/secret-engines/kubernetes`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/tree/main/terraform/modules/secrets-engines/kubernetes)


* `pki` - [`terraform/modules/secret-engines/pki`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/tree/main/terraform/modules/secrets-engines/pki)

CA that generates/signs certificates to used for Code Signing, OpenVPN authentication, etc.

* `ssh` [`terraform/modules/secret-engines/ssh`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/tree/main/terraform/modules/secrets-engines/ssh)

Currently works with the [agent-less SSH CA method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates).

* `vault` [`terraform/modules/secret-engines/vault`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/tree/main/terraform/modules/secrets-engines/vault) (policies only)

Is used only by the `adhoc` key, to directly create templated Vault policies that do not adhere to secret engine use-cases.

* *more to come (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databases, etc)*

##### Policy generation

For each role defined in your YAML, `vault-yaml` automatically generates appropriate policies based on each secrets engine's use case of credential generation. These policies are then attached to all principals referenced in the role's `access` block.

### `roles`

Defines roles that map directly to Vault/OpenBao Secret Engine roles.

####  Example:

```yaml
roles:
  web:
    ttl: 7776000
    allowed_domains:
      - example.com
    access: [...]
```

Roles serve two purposes:

1. **Vault configuration**: They configure the underlying Vault secret engine role (e.g., setting TTL, allowed domains, certificate parameters)
2. **Access control**: They define who can use this role through the `access` block

The keys you define in a role (e.g., `ttl`, `allowed_domains`) map directly to the corresponding Vault Terraform provider resource for that secret engine type. For example, `allowed_domains` corresponds to the same field in [`pki_secret_backend_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/resources/pki_secret_backend_role).

The `access` key is explained further below.

### Static and Conditional Access

Roles can define both static and conditional access:

- **Static access**: Principals have immediate, permanent access to use the role. No approval is required.

- **Conditional access**: Principals must request access and receive approval before using the role. This is implemented through the [GatePlane Policy Gate](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#policy-gate) plugin and is ideal for:
  - Sensitive operations requiring oversight
  - Multi-person approval workflows
  - Situations requiring justification documentation
  - Temporary access scenarios (hotfixes, maintenance, onboarding)

You can define both `static` and `conditional` access on the same role, allowing different levels of access for different users.

#### Example: Conditional access for user onboarding (certificate generation)

In this example, anyone can request a client certificate, but it must be approved by an Onboarder before being issued:

```yaml
roles:
  client-generate:
    client_flag: true
    ttl: 31536000
    access:
      conditional:
        requestors:
          - "ldap.groups.Everyone"
        approvers:
          - "ldap.groups.Onboarders"
        required_approvals: 1
        require_justification: false
```


### The `access` block

The `access` block is defined under each role to control who may use that role. It accepts two optional sub-blocks:

#### `static`

Grants immediate, permanent access to principals without requiring approval. Accepts a *list* (`[]`) of principal strings.

Use this for:
- Automated systems that need constant access
- Teams that require ongoing access to resources
- Operations that don't need oversight

```yaml
access:
  static:
    - "ldap.groups.Administrators"
    - "ldap.users.jdoe"
```

#### `conditional`

Requires approval before access is granted. Accepts a *map* (`{}`) with the following keys:

- `requestors`: List of principals who can submit access requests
- `approvers`: List of principals who can approve requests
- `required_approvals` *(optional, default: 1)*: Minimum number of approvals required
- `require_justification` *(optional, default: false)*: Whether requestors must provide a reason

Use this for:
- Production break-glass scenarios
- Temporary elevated privileges
- Security-sensitive operations
- Audit trail requirements

```yaml
access:
  conditional:
    requestors:
      - "ldap.groups.Developers"
    approvers:
      - "ldap.groups.KubernetesAdministrators"
      - "ldap.groups.cab"
    required_approvals: 2
    require_justification: true
```

A role can have both `static` and `conditional` access defined:

```yaml
access:
  static:
    - "ldap.groups.Administrators"
  conditional:
    requestors:
      - "ldap.groups.Developers"
    approvers:
      - "ldap.groups.Administrators"
    required_approvals: 1
    require_justification: true
```


### Authentication and *Principals*

Principals are represented as strings that combine the authentication method with the identity. This format tells `vault-yaml` **how** the user authenticates and **who** they are.

#### Supported principal formats

**1. LDAP authentication**

Format: `ldap.groups.<group-name>` or `ldap.users.<username>`

These principals are authenticated through your configured LDAP auth method. The user's username and group membership are pulled directly from your LDAP directory.

Examples:
- `ldap.groups.Developers`
- `ldap.users.jdoe`

**2. Vault/OpenBao identities**

Format: `identity.entity_id.<id>` or `identity.entity_name.<name>` or `identity.group_id.<id>` or `identity.group_name.<name>`

These principals reference entities or groups stored in Vault/OpenBao's identity system. They can be created manually or automatically through auth methods.

Examples:
- `identity.entity_id.f84a6248-b907-4119-bdd7-f47c8bf40bbf`
- `identity.entity_name.entity_e13c9ca6`
- `identity.group_id.30210932-96a2-f3de-bc39-24e49d543832`
- `identity.group_name.InternalAdmins`

> **Note:** Avoid managing [external Vault groups](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/identity#external-vs-internal-groups) with `vault-yaml`, as this can cause Terraform drift issues.

**3. JWT authentication** *(Work in Progress)*

Format: `jwt.<role>.<jwt-sub>`

Used for CI/CD pipelines and service accounts authenticating via JWT.

Example:
- `jwt.cicd.org/repo1` - Matches JWT `sub` claim `org/repo1` from the JWT auth mount with role `cicd`

### `adhoc` - Ad-Hoc Vault Policies

The `adhoc` section defines custom Vault/OpenBao policies that aren't tied to any specific Secrets Engine. Use this when you need fine-grained control over paths and capabilities that don't fit into the standard secret engine role model.

#### How it works

Each role in the `adhoc` section references a **policy template file** (`.hcl`) that contains the actual Vault policy rules. The template can reference variables for dynamic path generation.

#### Example:
```yaml
adhoc:
  type: vault
  roles:
    secrets-personal:
      access:
        static:
          - ldap.groups.Everyone
```

This configuration creates a policy from the template file [`roles/vault/secrets-personal.hcl`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/blob/main/roles/vault/secrets-personal.hcl) and attaches it to all users in the `Everyone` LDAP group.

#### Template variables

Your policy templates can access these pre-defined variables:
- **`secrets_engines`** - A map of all configured secret engines and their mount paths
- **`auth_methods`** - A map of all configured auth methods and their mount paths

This lets you write policies that dynamically reference your infrastructure without hardcoding paths.

For example, in a template:
```hcl
# The 'secrets_engines' parameter is templated by Terraform
# The {{ identity.entity.name }} directive is templated by Vault/OpenBao
path "${secrets_engines["kv"]["path"]}/data/users/{{ identity.entity.name }}" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
```

See [`terraform/main.tf#L66`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/blob/main/terraform/main.tf#L66) for how these maps are constructed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using `vault-yaml`, ensure you have:

- **Terraform** (v1.0+) installed and configured
- **Vault or OpenBao** server running and accessible
- **Terraform Vault provider** configured with authentication to your Vault/OpenBao instance
- Basic understanding of Vault concepts (secret engines, auth methods, policies)

### Starting fresh

If you're setting up a new Vault/OpenBao instance:

1. **Create a Vault/OpenBao instance** using the [Hashicorp official Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest).

2. **Configure authentication and secrets engines** using Terraform resources. For example:
   - Mount a secrets engine: [`vault_mount`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/resources/mount)
   - Add Kubernetes integration: [`vault_kubernetes_secret_backend`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_secret_backend)
   - Configure LDAP authentication: [`vault_ldap_auth_backend`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/resources/ldap_auth_backend)

3. **Connect your mounts to `vault-yaml` modules** by passing the mount path to the appropriate modules in `terraform/modules/secrets-engines` or `terraform/modules/auth-methods`. See [`main.tf`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/blob/main/terraform/main.tf#L34) for a complete example.

### Bring Your Own Vault (BYOV)

You can use vault-yaml with **existing Vault/OpenBao instances** - without replacing or disrupting your current configuration.

In this repository, the separation between `vault-yaml` and BYOV resources can be seen under `terraform/` directory. The `byov.tf` files are meant to pre-date the `vault-yaml` files (`main.tf`, `gateplane.tf`)

#### Gradual Migration

`vault-yaml` works alongside your existing setup:

- **Existing roles and policies are preserved** - `vault-yaml` does not delete or modify your existing configuration (`terraform plan` will fail if resources with the same name exist)
- **New resources are added incrementally** - your `accesses.yaml` file provisions new roles and policies defined in the YAML
- **No disruption to existing workflows** - your current operations continue uninterrupted

#### How it works

Simply reference your existing Secrets Engines and Auth Methods when configuring `vault-yaml` modules:

1. **For existing secrets engines**: Connect an existing mount (e.g., `/pki` or `/kubernetes`) to the corresponding `vault-yaml` module using the `mount` variable. The module will create new roles defined in your YAML alongside any existing roles.

2. **For existing auth methods**: Reference your existing auth methods in the configuration. This enables `vault-yaml` to use principals (users, groups, entities) that are already authenticated through those auth methods.

#### Example

If you have an existing Kubernetes engine referenced by Terraform with `vault_kubernetes_secret_backend.kubernetes`, that already contains legacy roles:

```hcl
module "kubernetes" {
  source = "github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml.git//terraform/modules/secrets-engines/kubernetes"

  // Tying the vault-yaml configuration with existing Secrets Engine
  mount = vault_kubernetes_secret_backend.kubernetes

  // The directory where Kubernetes roles are defined (roles/kubernetes/<role_name>.yaml)
  role_directory = "./roles/kubernetes"
  // The `yamldecode` of your accessess.yaml file
  accesses       = local.accesses
}
```

Your existing roles remain untouched, and the new roles defined in the `accessess.yaml` are added alongside them.

This approach allows you to **gradually adopt** `vault-yaml`'s declarative management style without requiring a risky "big bang" migration.

## 🎯 GatePlane Services

The GatePlane Policy Gate plugin is free and fully included with `vault-yaml` under the Elastic V2 License, providing conditional access, approval workflows, and time-bound credentials.

For enhanced visibility, you can subscribe to [GatePlane Services](https://gateplane.io) which adds real-time notifications (Slack, Teams, Discord) and access metrics/analytics to help you track usage patterns and identify bottlenecks.

To enable GatePlane Services, add/uncomment the `gateplane_services` module to your [`terraform/gateplane.tf`](https://github.com/gateplane-io/vault-yaml/blob/main/terraform/gateplane.tf) file:

After applying the configuration, run `terraform output gateplane_services_output` and send the output to `services@gateplane.io` to activate your subscription.

## 📦 What `vault-yaml` manages

`vault-yaml` focuses on **access control and role management**. Here's what's in scope:

✅ **Managed by `vault-yaml`:**
- Secret engine roles (e.g., PKI roles, Kubernetes roles, SSH roles)
- Policies associated with those roles
- Role-to-principal assignments (who can use which role)
- Ad-hoc Vault policies defined in templates
- Conditional access using GatePlane plugins transparently

❌ **Managed separately (not by `vault-yaml`):**
- Vault/OpenBao server configuration
- Authentication method setup (LDAP, JWT, etc.)
- Secret engine mounts and basic configuration
- Identity entities and groups (these must exist first)
- Root tokens, recovery keys, and server certificates
- Audit logs and monitoring setup

**Think of it this way:** `vault-yaml` builds the access layer on top of infrastructure you've already configured. You set up the Vault/OpenBao server, auth methods, and secret engines - then `vault-yaml` helps you manage "who has what access to what" in a declarative, auditable way.
